        <h2>Project Overview</h2>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Color blindness affects millions of people worldwide, making it difficult to distinguish certain colors in
            digital environments. This project aims to develop a user-friendly GUI that allows individuals to customize
            and adjust on-screen colors, improving visibility and accessibility. By providing real-time color filters
            and contrast enhancements, this tool will help color-blind users navigate their computers more effectively
            and comfortably.</p>

        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>Our motivation for this project comes from personal connections with friends and family members who struggle
            with color vision deficiency. Seeing firsthand how frustrating and limiting it can be to navigate a world
            designed for full-color vision, we want to contribute to a more inclusive digital environment. For example,
            while playing games together, we often encountered challenges due to a lack of player customization options
            for colorblind users.</p>

        <h3>Our Solution</h3>
        <p>Similar to a Microsoft accessibility tool, we plan to have an app that changes the display colors of your
            screen based on the colorblindness you have. This aims to make similar colors easier to distinguish. We’re
            not offering a one-size-fits-all solution — we aim to develop a flexible system that empowers users to
            customize their digital experience based on their specific needs and color perception challenges.</p>

        <h3>Issues with Current Alternatives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inconsistent Accessibility Across Programs:</strong> Many tools are app-specific. Users need
                consistent support across their entire system.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Support for Desktop Computers:</strong> Few accessible and free apps offer robust
                filtering and profile customization for desktop users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Principles Applied</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Limit user input to valid ranges to avoid unreadable screen settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Discoverability:</strong> Users should find settings easily without extensive instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Real-time visual changes reflect user adjustments.</li>
            <li><strong>Mappings:</strong> Changes like contrast increases immediately clarify text visibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Conceptual Model:</strong> Familiar controls like sliders and toggles make interaction
                intuitive.</li>
            <li><strong>Signifiers:</strong> Clear labels, icons, and tooltips guide user decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Affordances:</strong> Buttons and sliders visually indicate how they can be used.</li>
        </ul>
