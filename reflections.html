        <h2>Reflections and Conclusion</h2>

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>This project taught us the value of inclusive design and user-centered development. We understood that
            accessibility is not a feature but an integral part of digital product design. Talking to users with color
            blindness provided us with a glimpse into the everyday difficulties they encounter and highlighted
            the impact that careful design can have on their web experience. One of our main learnings was how to
            design with feasible constraints in mind, without the possibility to try out functionality with real-world
            interaction. This underscored the need for precise visual communication and clear interfaces. We also
            discovered how important it is to properly depict system feedback in a static or semi-interactive
            prototype, particularly when you're designing for accessibility. Finally, we discovered how some design
            decisions—like where a button goes or how well a slider is labeled—can have a huge impact on user
            understanding.</p>

        <h3>What Worked Well</h3>
        <p>Our iterative design process allowed us to respond quickly to feedback, leading to meaningful
            improvements such as the implementation of color boost sliders and real-time preview filters. </p>

        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <p>One challenge was ensuring that filter adjustments remained readable and accessible across various screen
            settings and lighting environments. Future versions could benefit from automated testing tools that simulate
            different types of color vision. Better use of animation and annotations within the prototype would have
            helped clarify these elements.</p>

        <h3>Meeting User Needs</h3>
        <p> Our prototype serves the needs of color vision deficiency users specifically by allowing them to personalize
            their online experience. Throughout the installation flow, profile creation and testing, every action was
            designed with accessibility in mind. Addition of a community-sharing mechanism also promotes collaborative
            improvement and shared experiences.</p>

        <h3>Impact of Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        <p>The heuristic evaluation process helped identify subtle usability issues, such as a lack of immediate
            feedback for some settings or inconsistent icon usage. By applying Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics, we
            refined elements such as system visibility, feedback, and user control. These changes significantly enhanced
            the clarity and intuitiveness of the final prototype.</p>
